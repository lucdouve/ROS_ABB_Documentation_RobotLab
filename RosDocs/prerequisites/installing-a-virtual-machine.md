# Installing a Virtual Machine 
ROS requires a Ubuntu as a operation system. The easiest way to use Ubuntu next to Windows or MacOS, is by using a virtual machine. Depending on what ROS version you will use, you will need a different version of Ubuntu. 

## Getting Ubuntu
Here we will be using ROS Melodic. So, we will need Ubuntu 18.04.  Below will be links to download Ubuntu and different options for virtual machines.

### Download links
Recommended:
[Ubuntu 18.04 download link](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

If by any chance you need to use ROS Kinetic, youâ€™ll need Ubuntu 16.04:
[Ubuntu 16.04 download link](http://no.releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/)

*When you are working with ABB Robots, ROS wiki and many forums recommend using Kinetic. However, there are no  differences between Kinetic and Melodic found when it comes to using ABB Packages.*

## VM Software Platforms
These software platforms can/must be used for running the VM's stated above.
