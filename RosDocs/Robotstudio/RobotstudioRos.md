# Robotstudio with ROS
### Robotstudio setup
First we will need to make some adjustments in the settings of our project. ROS provides a good explanation of how to do this on their wiki.

When you have completed those steps you can proceed to installing the server on your controller. Again this can be found on the ROS wiki and is explained in great detail.

Keep in mind this implementation is only viable for a single robot setup. To implement multiple robots follow the next steps.
