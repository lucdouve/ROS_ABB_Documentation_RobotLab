# ROS Guide with ABB
Welcome to our quick starter's guide to ROS and ABB! Here we will give a brief overview of the ROS environment in combination with the ABB Robotics ecosystem. This documentation is produced for the RobotLab, AUAS, Amsterdam location Leeuwenburg (Mid 2020).

## Getting started
#### Prerequisites
This guide assumes you have access to a windows machine and a linux machine. This might require you to install a virtual machine.

A virtual machine is higely recommended as it will keep your root system clean. This because, if something does go wrong you can quickly start over again without any damages to your file structure on your default machine.
